<h1>Winnie Hsiang's Profile</h1>
<p>"Why do you have to make things so complicated?" This sentence has been the most common evaluation given to me by my parents throughout my life. This is me, a person who is keen to follow steps, operate her own lifestyle, and insist on reaching goals.

Currently, I am a second-year computer engineering student in University of Toronto. I have learned and utilized C, Python, Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Arduino for making school projects and machine learning hackathons. During my first year, I obtained a 3.94 GPA with an average of A+ on my courses and I am also taking Bioengineering and Music Minor. Outside of school, I am a professional pianist.</p>
