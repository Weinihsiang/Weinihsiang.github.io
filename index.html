<h1>Winnie Hsiang's Profile</h1>
<p>"Why do you have to make things so complicated?" This sentence has been the most common evaluation given to me by my parents throughout my life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>This is me, a person who is keen to follow steps, operate her own lifestyle, and insist on reaching goals.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Currently, I am a second-year computer engineering student in University of Toronto. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>I have learned and utilized C, Python, Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Arduino for making projects and joining hackathons. During my first year, I obtained a 3.94 GPA with an average of A+ on my courses. Other than that, I am also taking Bioengineering and Music Minor. I enjoy playing piano and I am a professional pianist!</p>
